# Description of the project

this project is a 3D music visulisation. It is a big sphere consists of a circle formed by 128 3D cube objects and a sphere formed by 360  3D sphere objects. All the cube objects and sphere objects will deform as the music plays. the whole sphere will rotate around the axis and change the speed with the intensity of the music.  

# Instructions for use
run the project in the unity. All music sources are in the Audios folder. if user want to change music, please attach the music to the Audio script. if user want to cahnge the scale of the object, please change the value of the scale in the GenerateCubes class and GenerateSpheres class.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
